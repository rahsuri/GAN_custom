# Customizable GAN model

A GAN that can be customized to fit any preferred dataset; Reccomended to use images under 100x100 resolution.

This project was originally created to suit the fashion_mnist dataset(https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist).

Other datasets can be uploaded into the GAN for training and generating. 

Please let me know of any issues you may come across.

Enjoy!
